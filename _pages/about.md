* Unequal Health Impact of Gold Mining in the Brazilian Amazon (with Yifan (Flora) He, Jacqueline de Aguiar Barros, and Robert Heilmayr)

Small-scale and artisanal gold mining (ASGM) can degrade the environment and lead to a variety of negative health outcomes associated with mercury use and mosquito-borne diseases. Gold mining has been accelerating in the Brazilian Amazon in the past decade, raising concerns over its impact on population health, especially health of Indigenous peoples. Yet, no study has systematically documented the health impact of gold mining across the Brazilian Amazon, and causal evidence is lacking. In this study, we use an instrumental variable design with cluster LASSO variable selection to isolate the effect of gold mining on health. We find that gold mining increases malaria, dengue, and Zika prevalence among the general population. Gold mining negatively affect Indigenous populations in several indicators of newborn health, and the magnitude of impact increases with time. Mining has mixed impact on newborn health among the general population. Our results highlight the broad, long-lasting, and unequal health effects of gold mining in the Brazilian Amazon. We provide key evidence to guide policy interventions in regulating gold mining and addressing its health impacts.
